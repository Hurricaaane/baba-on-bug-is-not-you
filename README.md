## Setup

Copy your game's `Data/` directory as a subfolder of this repository's `game/` directory, in such a way that the directory `game/Data/` will exist.

The game files are ignored from git through `.gitignore` for convenience.

## Run

- Linux is `./test/test_basic_facade.lua`
- Windows is `lua test\test_basic_facade.lua`
